There are a number of variables listed below. What are the different types and how do you know which is which?

```Ruby
excited_dog = "excited dog"
@excited_dog = "excited dog"
@@excited_dog = "excited dog"
```

1. Local variable
2. Instance variable
3. Class variable

You know because of the prefix. A varible with no prefix is a local variable, one `@` is an instance varible, and two `@`s (`@@`) is a class variable.
